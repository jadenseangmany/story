### Academic Interests
I'm interested in interdisciplinary studies with electrical engineering, computer science, and other fields like environmental science or biology, primarily because I enjoy learning, and my dream is to learn as much as I can before I die. I plan to pursue research as my career, and pursue a PHD degree. 
### Non Academic Interests
For non academic related things, I am a competitive badminton player, where I ranked top 5 for international tournaments. I'm also part of organizations like HKN where I'm doing outreach to teach ECE related topics to elementary schoolers and high schoolers for ECE 198.
